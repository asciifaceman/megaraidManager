megaMAN
=======

Python front-end developed for MegaRAID's MegaCLI. Harvests and presents raid and drive information in a quickly digestible table-based format.

Currently only tested on Linux servers with properly installed megaCLI.
Will be adding a script to ensure megaCLI is installed and in the right place.
